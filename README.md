## Libraries <a name="libraries"></a>

 Python libraries used for this project include:
1. scikit learn
2. pandas
3. numpy
4. stats
5. matplotlib
6. seaborn

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I was motivated by my interest in investing in the Airbnb business, so i wanted to extract insights that airbnb investors could leverage to make some strategic decisions and maximise returns:

1. What type of listings command the highest rate in the market?
2. Do listing rates differ by location?
3. What variables correlate well with rates? Can i predict the rate of a new listing?
4. What is the demand for airbnb occupancy at various times of the year?



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

This project was broken down into three major insights, each represented by a Jupyter notebook file
1. Project 1 Blog Post EDA.ipynb - contains Exploratory Data Analysis, descriptive statistics and ML predictions done on the "listings" dataset 
2. Project 1 Blog Post Prediction.ipynb - continuation of the first file showing alternative ML algorithm and comparing results.
3. Project 1 Blog Post Analyzing Airbnb Occupancy Across Months.ipynb - contains analysis on Airbnb demand in Boston



## Results<a name="results"></a>

Results were communicated in my medium post available [here](https://medium.com/@kknana556/data-driven-discoveries-for-airbnb-investors-5c5026054464).
